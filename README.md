## Development

If you want to hack on this project, here is how you do it.

<details><summary>Show building instructions</summary>

#### Installing dependencies

Install Node.js 12 first (or if you use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), switch to Node.js 12 by running `nvm use`).

```bash
npm install
```

#### Starting in development mode

```bash
npm start
```

The debugger tools are available when running in dev mode and can be activated with keyboard shortcuts as defined here https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-debug#features.

It can also be displayed automatically from the `SHOW_DEV_TOOLS` environment variable such as:

```bash
SHOW_DEV_TOOLS=true npm start
```

or from the application `--show-dev-tools` command line flag.

#### Building the production distribution

```bash
npm run dist
```

#### Working with jitsi-meet-electron-utils

[jitsi-meet-electron-utils] is a helper package which implements many features
such as remote control and the always-on-top window. If new features are to be
added / tested, running with a local version of these utils is very handy, here
is how to do that.

By default the jitsi-meet-electron-utils is build from its git repository
sources. The default dependency path in package.json is:

```json
"jitsi-meet-electron-utils": "jitsi/jitsi-meet-electron-utils"
```

To work with local copy you must change the path to:

```json
"jitsi-meet-electron-utils": "file:///Users/name/jitsi-meet-electron-utils-copy",
```

To build the project you must force it to take the sources as `npm update` will
not do it.

```bash
npm install jitsi-meet-electron-utils --force
```

NOTE: Also check the [jitsi-meet-electron-utils README] to see how to configure
your environment.

## Known issues

### Windows

A warning will show up mentioning the app is unsigned upon first install. This is expected.

### macOS

On macOS Catalina a warning will be displayed on first install. The app won't open unless "open" is pressed. This dialog is only shown once.
Builtin auto-updates are not yet handled in macOS due to unsigned build.

### GNU/Linux

There is a known issue which prevents the app from starting on some Linux distributions: #231

If after downloading it, you can't execute the file directly, try running `chmod u+x ./jitsi-meet-x86_64.AppImage`

The workaround for now is to launch the app like so: `./jitsi-meet-x86_64.AppImage --no-sandbox`

<details><summary>NOTE for old GNU/Linux distributions</summary>

You might get the following error:

```
FATAL:nss_util.cc(632)] NSS_VersionCheck("3.26") failed. NSS >= 3.26 is required.
Please upgrade to the latest NSS, and if you still get this error, contact your
distribution maintainer.
```

If you do, please install NSS (example for Debian / Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt-get install libnss3
```
